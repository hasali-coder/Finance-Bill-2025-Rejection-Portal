# 🇰🇪 **Finance Bill 2025 Rejection Portal**  
#### *Gen Z meets Civic Tech. Tulikataa!*

> ✊🏾 Powered by vibes, anger, and the Constitution. 

## 🚨 What’s Going On?

The **Finance Bill 2025** wants to mess with our rights again —  
This time by trying to delete **Section 59A(1B)** of the Tax Procedures Act.  
That’s the only thing stopping KRA from snooping into your **M-Pesa data**.  
Yes, your *"nikusort kesho boss"* texts. Your *OdiBet*, *Chamaa*, *Grocery*... ALL of it.  

## 🧠 What This Site Does

This is a 🔥 **one-click email launcher** that sends a well-crafted objection to Parliament:

✅ Drafted with legal sauce  
✅ Auto-addressed to:  
- `cna@parliament.go.ke`  
- `financecommitteeena@parliament.go.ke`  
✅ Opens in Gmail  
✅ All you do? **Click. Review. Send.**

No stress. No typing essays. No printing and lining up at Parliament.  
It’s public participation... but Gen Z style 🧢.
